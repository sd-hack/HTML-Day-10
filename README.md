    <h1>What is Semantic HTML?</h1>
    <p>
        Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML tags that convey the meaning (or semantics) of the content they enclose. Unlike generic tags like &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt;, which don't provide any information about the content, semantic tags clearly describe the role of the content, making it easier for browsers, developers, and search engines to understand the structure of the webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Semantic HTML also improves accessibility, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and the maintainability of code. Using the appropriate semantic tags helps search engines index your content better, and it ensures that assistive technologies can accurately interpret the page.

    <h2>1. What is Semantic HTML?</h2>
    <p>
        Semantic HTML involves using HTML tags that have a clear meaning. These tags describe their content, making the document easier to read and navigate. Examples include &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;nav&gt;.<br />
        Using semantic tags also improves the accessibility of your website, as screen readers and other assistive technologies can better interpret the content. Additionally, search engines rank websites better when semantic HTML is used because it helps them understand the structure of your page.
